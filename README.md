# 42_BSQ

✅ Passed Moulinette with 100/100 ✅

❌ Failed peer evaluations only due to an *accidental wildcard in Makefile*, which counted as a Norm violation. It's a pretty straightforward fix. Everything else about the project is good.

## About



## How to run

Pass filename as a command line argument like so:

`./bsq test_maps/50x20`

BSQ can also take in standard input, for example:

`cat test_maps/50x20 | ./bsq `

./bsq executable was compiled to work on school iMacs. It is **recommeneded to recompile** it for your own machine using `make re` before running.
